    <h3 id="headline">Alan Turing Life Timeline</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1923</strong> - Born in Maida Vale, London, England</li>
        <li><strong>1931</strong> - Entered University of Cambridge to study mathematics</li>
        <li><strong>1935</strong> - Elected a fellow of King's College in recognition of his research in probability theory</li>
        <li><strong>1936</strong> - Published seminal paper "On Compatible Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem (Decision Problem)" which has profound signifigance for the emerging science of computing</li>
        <li><strong>1936</strong> - In the course of his paper, invents the universal Turing Machine, an abstract machine that would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm</li>
        <li><strong>1938</strong> - Completed Ph.D in mathematical logic at Princeton University, writes dissertation where he introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing</li>
        <li><strong>1938</strong> - Worked part time with the Government Code and Cypher School, a british codebreaking organization</li>
        <li><strong>1940</strong> - Helped design codebreaking machine known as the Bomba, which supplied allies with large amount of military intelligence</li>
        <li><strong>1942</strong> - Devised first systematic method for breaking messages encrypted by the German cypher machine called "Tunny"</li>
        <li><strong>1946</strong> - Made an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for his work on code breaking during the war </li>
        <li><strong>1948</strong> - Helped create first chess computer game ever to enter development</li>
        <li><strong>1950</strong> - Wrote paper in which he proposed the Turing test, which was an attempt to define a standard for computing machines and artificial intelligence</li>
        <li><strong>1951</strong> - Wrote the first ever programming manual for the first marketable electronic digital computer, the Ferranti Mark 1</li>
        <li><strong>1952</strong> - Convicted of British crime of homosexuality, sentenced to 12 months of hormone therapy</li>
        <li><strong>1954</strong> - Dies at home from cyanide posioning, unclear if death was suicide or accidental posioning</li>
